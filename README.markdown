# Soundwalks.org

Soundwalks.org will be a social network for sharing, annotating, and mapping environmental sound recordings. Soundwalks uses the Soundwalk Ruby library: http://github.com/plant/soundwalk.

The current source reflects a very simplistic interface to basic feature-extraction capabilities of the Soundwalk library.
