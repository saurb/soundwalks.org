	About Soundwalks
	
%h1{:style => 'text-align: left'} The World Soundscape
%p Soundwalks is a unique community for exploring the world's soundscape. Soundwalks leverages user-submitted field recordings, or "soundwalks," and novel audio processing techniques to let you hear any point on the globe as if you were really there. 

%h1{:style => 'text-align: left'} Social Experiences
%p Soundwalks takes listening to another level with a complete social network that allows you to share, discuss, and describe the world. In addition to exploration, you can share your recorded experiences with your friends and the rest of the world with easy-to-use tools. Additionally, you can record your explorations on the web as "virtual soundwalks," composing your own sonic tours for others to experience.

%h2{:style => 'text-align: left'} Technology
%p Soundwalks.org uses the <a href="http://github.com/plant/sirens-ruby">sirens-ruby</a> library for segmentation, indexing, and retrieval of environmental sounds. Additionally, <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a> allows the site to make use of semantic relationships between  sound descriptions. The site is built using the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> framework and is <a href="http://github.com/plant/soundwalks.org">open source</a>.
